## About our project:
The 2020 Olympic tournament was delayed one year due to the unforgivable Covid-19 pandemic. With this looming around the Olympic games, many around the world were not able to fully experience the sacred event which comes every four years. With this in mind, we created an interactive dashboard to help inform the end user about the competition including gender participation and medal information for each discipline and event. From there, we deployed our dashboard on GitHub pages.

Our data comes from a kaggle data set that included athletes, coaches, medals and technical officials information. From the data provided, we chose to focus on the athlete and medals data for our dashboard. Athletes information included their name, gender, country they represented and their event's discipline. The medals information included the medal type, the athletes who won medals, the events and number and types of medals won by country.

This would be useful to sports analysts, Olympic historians and hobbyists and even athlete's by having a place to check Olympic related information. This would also be helpful to the casual Olympic fan who weren't in a place to watch the Olympics due to lower coverage because of the pandemic.
